    "        What is the approximate depth of a Decision Tree trained (without restrictions) on a training set with one million instances?\n",

    "        A perfectly skewed tree, meaning no balance at all, would be 1,000,000 deep, but that would not be a realistic result. A realistic result is\n",
    "        a fairly balanced tree with a depth a little above 20, between 21 and 30 is a realistic approximation.\n",

    "    Question #3:\n",
    "        If a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try decreasing max_depth?\n",
    "            The chapter states, \"Increasing min_* hyperparameters or reducing max_* hyperparameters will regularize the model.\" Regularization is\n",
    "        one way of preventing/reducing overfitting, so decreasing max_depth of the Decision tree would definitelty be a good solution to prevent \n",
